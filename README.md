# The EPA's Climate Change Site

> **UPDATE:** The Trump administration [has decided against removing the site for the time being](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-backtracks-on-plan-to-take-down-epa-climate-web-page/). Since this project is focused on keeping the material easily accessible and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) and many others are backing up all the data, I'm going to halt work on this until they change their minds again. 

President Trump [has ordered the EPA](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-epa-climatechange-idUSKBN15906G) to remove their [climate change page](https://www.epa.gov/climatechange) from their website.

Many people have been working to back up scientific data since Trump won the election (see [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/592742410/azimuth-climate-data-backup-project?ref=user_menu) and [here](http://www.ppehlab.org/), among others). This repository is intended to save the accessible, easily readable content from the EPA's website so people can still browse it and learn about climate change. 

The EPA's site should also still be available on the [Way Back Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170125022503/https://www.epa.gov/climatechange).

If you're familiar with Github and would like to add content to this repository:

1. Pick a page from the [EPA's site](https://www.epa.gov/climatechange).
2. Open a pull request on this repository to add the page. (See other pages for examples. All pages are in markdown. Try to include graphs.)
